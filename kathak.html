      <h1>Kathak</h1>
      <p>
        Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance,
        originating from North India. Known for its intricate footwork, graceful
        spins, and expressive storytelling, Kathak blends rhythm, drama, and
        devotion into a captivating performance style.
      </p>

      <h2>Origin and History</h2>
      <p>
        The word "Kathak" is derived from the Sanskrit word <em>Katha</em>,
        meaning "story." The dance began as a storytelling tradition performed
        by traveling bards known as <em>Kathakars</em> who recounted
        mythological and religious tales in temples and village squares. During
        the Mughal era, Kathak underwent a transformation, adopting Persian and
        Islamic influences, which added stylized movements and courtly elegance.
        It evolved further in the courts of Lucknow, Jaipur, and Banaras, each
        giving rise to distinct <em>gharanas</em>
        or schools.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning of the Name</h2>
      <p>
        The name "Kathak" comes from "Katha" (story) and "Kathakar"
        (storyteller), emphasizing its narrative foundation. Unlike other
        classical dance forms, Kathak places equal importance on both
        <strong>nritta</strong> (pure dance) and
        <strong>abhinaya</strong> (expression).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nritta</strong> – Rhythmic footwork, spins, and swift
          movements
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nritya</strong> – Expressive storytelling through facial
          gestures and hand movements
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Natya</strong> – Dramatic enactment of mythological and
          emotional narratives
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Costume and Makeup</h2>
      <p>
        Kathak dancers wear traditional Mughal-inspired attire. Female dancers
        typically wear long, flowing <em>anarkali</em> suits with churidar
        leggings, adorned with dupattas and jewelry. Male dancers wear a
        kurta-churidar with angavastram. Makeup is subtle but enhances the eyes
        and facial expressions. <em>Ghungroos</em> (ankle bells) play a central
        role in highlighting rhythmic footwork.
      </p>

      <h2>Music and Instruments</h2>
      <p>
        Kathak is performed to Hindustani classical music. Key instruments
        include the tabla and pakhawaj (for rhythm), along with harmonium,
        sarangi, sitar, and flute. The <em>nattuvanar</em> or conductor provides
        vocal cues and rhythmic syllables (<em>bols</em>) that guide the
        dancer's movements and improvisation.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        Kathak continues to thrive on contemporary and global stages. It is
        taught in prestigious institutions across India and abroad. Modern
        choreographers often blend Kathak with other dance forms to explore new
        themes while maintaining its traditional roots. It is performed in
        festivals, theatres, and even in experimental formats.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Kathak is more than a dance; it is a living tradition of storytelling
        that bridges the spiritual, cultural, and historical narratives of
        India. From temple courtyards to royal courts and modern stages, it
        remains a symbol of grace, intellect, and devotion. Through its rhythmic
        elegance and expressive richness, Kathak connects generations to India's
        diverse cultural fabric.
