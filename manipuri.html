      <h1>Manipuri</h1>
      <p>
        Manipuri is one of India’s eight classical dance forms, originating from
        the northeastern state of Manipur. Renowned for its graceful, flowing
        movements and spiritual depth, Manipuri emphasizes devotion, subtle
        expression, and lyrical beauty. It is deeply embedded in the religious
        and cultural life of the Manipuri people.
      </p>

      <h2>Origin and History</h2>
      <p>
        Manipuri has ancient roots linked to local folk traditions and religious
        rituals, but it developed into a classical form with the spread of
        Vaishnavism in the 15th century. King Bhagyachandra played a pivotal
        role in systematizing the dance in the 18th century by introducing
        themes from the life of Lord Krishna and choreographing dances like the
        Ras Lila. Originally performed in temples, Manipuri maintained its
        devotional essence over the centuries.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and Themes</h2>
      <p>
        The dance form is a medium of <strong>Bhakti</strong> (devotion),
        focusing on divine love and the spiritual bond between Radha and
        Krishna. It is performed during major festivals like Janmashtami and
        Holi. The stories are narrated through gentle hand gestures and circular
        body movements that evoke serenity and devotion.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lasya</strong> – Graceful and delicate feminine movements,
          often performed by women in Ras Lila
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tandava</strong> – Vigorous and powerful movements, typically
          by male dancers portraying warriors or deities
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abhinaya</strong> – Expressive interpretation using subtle
          facial expressions and mudras
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Costume and Makeup</h2>
      <p>
        Manipuri costumes are distinct and elegant. Female dancers wear the
        traditional <em>Potloi</em>, a cylindrical skirt with intricate
        embroidery and a translucent veil. Male dancers wear dhotis and turbans.
        The makeup is natural, aiming to preserve the serene and devotional
        feel, with minimal facial embellishment to maintain the dance's subtle
        expressiveness.
      </p>

      <h2>Music and Instruments</h2>
      <p>
        The dance is accompanied by Manipuri classical music rooted in folk and
        devotional traditions. Instruments include the
        <em>pung</em> (barrel drum), <em>kartal</em> (cymbals),
        <em>sankirtan</em> vocals, and flute. The
        <strong>Pung Cholom</strong> is a unique drum dance where performers
        play the pung while dancing, combining rhythm with acrobatics.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        Manipuri continues to be a living tradition, preserved in temples,
        festivals, and academies across India. It is performed on national and
        international stages, often as part of cultural exchange and educational
        programs. Institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru Manipur Dance Academy
        nurture new generations of dancers, while gurus and performers carry its
        legacy forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Manipuri represents the devotional heart of Manipur’s cultural identity.
        Its seamless blend of spirituality, poetry, and aesthetics makes it one
        of the most inward-looking and meditative classical dance forms. Whether
        in temple courtyards or global theatres, Manipuri continues to embody
        sacred love, devotion, and timeless beauty.
