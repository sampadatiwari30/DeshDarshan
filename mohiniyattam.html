      <h1>Mohiniyattam</h1>
      <p>
        Mohiniyattam is one of India’s eight classical dance forms, hailing from
        the southern state of Kerala. Known for its soft, graceful movements and
        emotive storytelling, Mohiniyattam embodies feminine charm and devotion.
        The name is derived from "Mohini" – the mythical enchantress avatar of
        Lord Vishnu – and "attam," meaning dance.
      </p>

      <h2>Origin and History</h2>
      <p>
        Rooted in the temples of Kerala, Mohiniyattam evolved as a solo dance
        performed by women, often as an offering to the deities. It flourished
        under the patronage of royal courts and temples during the 18th and 19th
        centuries. The dance declined during colonial times but was revived in
        the 20th century by scholars and dancers like Vallathol Narayana Menon
        and Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and Themes</h2>
      <p>
        Mohiniyattam is deeply devotional and typically explores themes from
        Hindu mythology, especially stories involving Vishnu, Krishna, and
        Shiva. It is expressive yet restrained, relying on
        <strong>Bhakti</strong> (devotion), <strong>Sringara</strong> (love),
        and <strong>Karuna</strong> (compassion). The movements are circular,
        fluid, and graceful, mirroring the swaying of palm trees in the Kerala
        landscape.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lasya</strong> – Delicate, feminine energy expressed through
          smooth body movements and soft footwork
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abhinaya</strong> – Expressive gestures and facial expressions
          to convey emotion and narrative
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Satvika</strong> – Spiritual and emotional connection
          portrayed through subtle inner expression
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Costume and Makeup</h2>
      <p>
        The traditional Mohiniyattam costume is elegant and understated: a white
        or off-white kasavu saree with golden borders, worn in a unique draping
        style. The dancer’s hair is tied into a bun on one side and adorned with
        jasmine flowers. Makeup is minimal, with special attention given to the
        eyes and eyebrows to enhance expressiveness. Ornamental jewelry and a
        gentle smile complete the look of the divine enchantress.
      </p>

      <h2>Music and Instruments</h2>
      <p>
        Mohiniyattam is performed to the soft and melodic tunes of Carnatic
        music, often incorporating lyrics in Manipravalam (a mix of Sanskrit and
        Malayalam). Key instruments include the <em>mridangam</em>,
        <em>idakka</em>, <em>violin</em>, <em>flute</em>, and <em>veena</em>.
        The rhythm is gentle and supports the lyrical flow of the dance.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Mohiniyattam enjoys global recognition, taught in academies like
        Kerala Kalamandalam and performed on prestigious stages worldwide.
        Dancers explore both traditional themes and modern expressions, keeping
        the art form vibrant and relevant. Contemporary practitioners continue
        to blend innovation with tradition, enriching the dance’s narrative
        power.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Mohiniyattam is a symbol of Kerala’s cultural identity and feminine
        grace. It transcends entertainment, offering a meditative, spiritual
        experience rooted in classical aesthetics. As an enduring expression of
        devotion and beauty, Mohiniyattam continues to enchant audiences with
        its serenity, depth, and timeless elegance.
