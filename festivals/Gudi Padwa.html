<h1>GUDI PADWA</h1>
<p>Gudi Padwa is a spring festival marking the start of the lunisolar new year for Marathi and Konkani Hindus. It is celebrated in and around Maharashtra, Goa and Daman at the start of Chaitra, the first month of the lunisolar Hindu calendar.

<img class="img img1" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/gudi-padwa-marathi-new-year-indian-festival-175907687.jpg" alt="Gudi Padwa" style="height: 20rem; width: 18rem;">
The festival is characterised by colourful floor decorations called rangoli, a special gudi dhvaja; which is a saari or dhoti or other piece of cloth garlanded with flowers, mango and neem leaves; a sugar crystal garland called gathi, topped with upturned silver or copper vessels. Celebration also includes street gathering, dancing and festive foods.
In Maharashtra, the first day of the bright phase of the moon is called guḍhī pāḍwā (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा), pāḍvo (Konkani: पाडवो); pāḍya (Kannada: ಪಾಡ್ಯ); pāḍyami (Telugu: పాడ్యమి). Konkani Hindus variously refer to the day as sausāra pāḍavo or sausāra pāḍyo (सौसार पाडवो and सौसार पाडयो, respectively). Kannada Hindus in Karnataka refer to it as Yugādi/Ugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ), while Telugu Hindus celebrate the same occasion as Ugadi (ఉగాది). Sindhi people celebrate the day as Cheti Chand, and Kashmiri Pandits celebrate this day as Navreh.

However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival, also known as Bestu Varas. For many others, the new year falls on Vaisakhi between 13 and 15 April, according to the solar cycle part of the Hindu lunisolar calendar and this is by far the most popular not only among Hindus of the Indian subcontinent but also among Buddhists and Hindus of Southeast Asia.

<h3>The Gudi</h3>
<p>Gudi means 'flag'; according to Kittel, the term is of South Indian origin.

The word pāḍavā is derived from the Sanskrit word pratipad for the first day of each fortnight in a lunar month, or the first day on which the moon appears after the "new moon" day (amāvāsya) and the first day after the full moon. A Gudi is also hoisted on this occasion, gives this festival its name. The term padva or padavo is also associated with Balipratipada.During Gudi Padwa, gudi (or gudhi) are arranged at every household. It is a bright, colourful silk scarf-like cloth tied at the top of a long bamboo. On top of it, one or more boughs of neem and mango leaves are attached with a garland of flowers. It is capped with a silver, bronze, or copper pot (handi or kalash), signifying victory or achievement.
Some temples are located on the top of hills, and groups work together to help reach the kavad to the top.</p>

<p style="text-align: start; margin: auto;">Some of the significances attributed to raising a gudi are as follows:</p>
<li>It symbolises the victory of King Shalivahana and was hoisted by his people when he returned to Paithan.</li>
<li>It symbolises Brahma's flag mentioned in the Brahma Purana, and may also represent Indra's flag.</li>
<li>It is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into the house.</li>

The Prabhat Pheri called street processions are held throughout Maharashtra on this special day followed by dance and food festivals. During the processions, many men and women tie a saffron-colored turban around their heads.
This is a time of the year when the sun's rays increase in intensity, going from mellow to hot. The crops have been harvested and the fruits of the harvest are making their way to the marketplaces. Mangoes, called "the king of fruit" in India, are in season once again. The ripe smell of jackfruit fills the air. Shrubs and trees are bursting into flower. Everything is fresh and new. It looks and smells like spring (or the best impersonation of quintessential springtime that the climate can do).
The word ‘padwa’ is derived from Pratipada, the first day of a lunar month or the first day after new moon day (Amavasya). Being the first day of the first month of a year, Gudhi Padwa is the New Year's Day for Maharashtrians. India was, and still is to a certain extent, a predominantly agrarian society. Thus, celebrations and festivals were often linked to the turn of the season and to the sowing and reaping of crops. This day marks the end of one harvest and the beginning of a new one, which for an agricultural community signifies the beginning of a New Year. In the case of Gudhi Padwa, it is celebrated at the end of the Rabi season. The term ‘padava’ or ‘padavo’ is also associated with Diwali, another New Year celebration that comes at the end of the harvesting season, thus substantiating the agricultural link to the festival.
