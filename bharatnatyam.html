      <h1>Bharatanatyam</h1>
      <p>
        Bharatanatyam is a revered classical dance form from the South Indian
        state of Tamil Nadu. Known for its grace, purity, and emotional depth,
        it is considered one of the oldest dance traditions in India, with roots
        stretching back over 2,000 years.
      </p>

      <h2>Origin and History</h2>
      <p>
        Bharatanatyam originated in the temples of Tamil Nadu as a form of
        devotional expression. It was traditionally performed by temple dancers
        called <em>devadasis</em>, who dedicated their lives to temple service
        and performed the dance as a part of religious rituals. Over time, the
        dance transitioned from temples to theatres, especially during the 20th
        century, due to efforts by artists and revivalists who aimed to preserve
        India's classical arts.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning of the Name</h2>
      <p>
        The term "Bharatanatyam" is often broken down into three syllables
        derived from Sanskrit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bhava</strong> – expression or emotion</li>
        <li><strong>Raga</strong> – melody or musical note</li>
        <li><strong>Tala</strong> – rhythmic pattern</li>
        <li><strong>Natyam</strong> – dance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these elements form the essence of Bharatanatyam, representing
        a holistic art that combines music, expression, and rhythm into a single
        powerful performance. Bharatanatyam is characterized by a fixed upper
        torso, bent legs (aramandi posture), intricate footwork, and a
        sophisticated vocabulary of hand gestures and facial expressions used to
        convey emotions and stories. The dance is typically structured into a
        repertoire known as the <em>Margam</em>, which includes items like
        Alarippu, Varnam, and Tillana.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nritta</strong>: Pure dance movements, focused on rhythm and
          form
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nritya</strong>: Expressive dance, combining rhythm with
          emotion
        </li>
        <li><strong>Natya</strong>: Dramatic storytelling through dance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Costume and Makeup</h2>
      <p>
        Performers wear vibrant silk sarees stitched into a special costume with
        pleats that fan out during movements. Jewelry includes headpieces,
        necklaces, earrings, bangles, and waist belts, often made of gold or
        imitation metal. Makeup is exaggerated for stage visibility, especially
        around the eyes to highlight expressions. The dancer also wears
        <em>ghungroos</em> (ankle bells) to accentuate footwork.
      </p>

      <h2>Music and Instruments</h2>
      <p>
        Bharatanatyam is typically accompanied by Carnatic music, with live
        musicians playing instruments such as the mridangam (drum), violin,
        flute, and veena. A vocalist sings compositions in Tamil, Sanskrit, or
        Telugu, guiding the dancer through emotional and narrative expressions.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Bharatanatyam is practiced by dancers around the world and is
        performed on global stages, festivals, and competitions. It has become a
        medium for both traditional religious expression and contemporary
        storytelling. Institutions and dance schools continue to train students
        in this discipline, keeping the art form alive and evolving.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond performance, Bharatanatyam is a spiritual experience for both the
        dancer and the audience. It is considered a form of
        <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>, or devotion through art. The dance not only
        preserves ancient stories and rituals but also embodies a rich heritage
        that connects generations through culture, discipline, and divine
        expression.
