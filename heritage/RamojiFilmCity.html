<h3>History</h3>
<p>The history of Ramoji Film City begins with the vision of Cherukuri Ramoji Rao, a renowned entrepreneur, media mogul, and film producer, who wanted to establish a world-class integrated film production facility in India. In the late 1980s, when Indian cinema was rapidly growing, filmmakers had to struggle with scattered resources—different places for sets, studios, editing, dubbing, and post-production. Ramoji Rao envisioned a place where everything could be brought under one roof, saving both time and cost for the industry.

In 1991, this dream took shape on the outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana, when Ramoji Film City was inaugurated. The art director Nitish Roy, famous for designing grand sets in Indian cinema, played a crucial role in planning the infrastructure. Spread across 2,000 acres, the complex was carefully crafted to include permanent sets such as palaces, temples, airports, railway stations, gardens, and cityscapes, along with sound stages and technologically advanced studios. This made it possible to shoot diverse films without having to travel to multiple locations.

Within a few years, Ramoji Film City became a favorite shooting spot for Indian filmmakers. Telugu cinema (Tollywood) was the first to fully utilize the facilities, followed by Bollywood and other regional industries. Movies in Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and even international languages were shot here. Over the decades, more than 2,500 films across various languages have been filmed within its premises.
A significant milestone came when the Guinness World Records officially recognized Ramoji Film City as the largest film studio complex in the world, bringing it global fame. Its success also transformed Hyderabad into a major hub of the Indian film industry.

Gradually, Ramoji Film City opened its doors to the public, blending cinema with tourism. Visitors were given the chance to explore film sets, watch live shows, and enjoy theme-park-style attractions. This expansion into entertainment tourism added a new chapter to its history, making it not just a hub for cinema but also one of India’s top tourist destinations.
Today, more than three decades since its founding, Ramoji Film City stands as a symbol of Ramoji Rao’s vision and India’s cinematic ambition, combining the worlds of filmmaking, tourism, and creativity on an unmatched scale.</p>
