<h1>MYSORE PALACE</h1>
<p>The Mysore Palace, also called the Amba Vilas Palace, is one of the most magnificent and well-known palaces in India. It is located in the city of Mysuru, Karnataka, and is considered a jewel of Indian architecture and heritage. The palace was the residence of the Wadiyar dynasty, who ruled the Kingdom of Mysore for several centuries. It is not only a royal residence but also a cultural landmark that attracts millions of tourists from India and abroad every year.

The original palace was built in the 14th century, but it was destroyed and rebuilt several times. The present structure was commissioned in 1897 after a fire destroyed the old wooden palace during a royal wedding. It was completed in 1912 under the rule of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, with British architect Henry Irwin designing it. The palace represents the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, which is a blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles. This mixture makes the palace truly unique and breathtaking.

The Mysore Palace is a three-storied building made of grey granite, with deep pink marble domes and a tall five-storied tower. The grand entrance gates, beautifully decorated arches, and sprawling gardens add to its royal charm. The interiors of the palace are even more spectacular. The Durbar Hall (royal court hall) has intricately designed ceilings and pillars, while the Kalyana Mantapa (marriage hall) is decorated with stunning stained-glass ceilings and mosaic floors. The palace also houses a rich collection of royal jewelry, paintings, costumes, and weapons that reflect the glory of the Wadiyars.

One of the most enchanting features of Mysore Palace is its illumination. Every evening on Sundays, public holidays, and during the famous Dasara festival, the entire palace is lit up with nearly 100,000 golden bulbs. This sight is truly mesmerizing and attracts thousands of visitors who gather to witness its sparkling beauty. During the Mysuru Dasara celebrations, the palace becomes the center of grand processions, cultural events, and traditional performances, keeping alive the heritage and culture of Karnataka.

Today, the Mysore Palace is maintained by the Government of Karnataka and has become the second most visited tourist attraction in India after the Taj Mahal. It is not only a historical building but also a symbol of pride for the people of Karnataka. The palace reflects the rich cultural, artistic, and architectural traditions of India.

In conclusion, the Mysore Palace is a living testimony of India’s royal past and cultural grandeur. Its architectural beauty, historical importance, and cultural significance make it one of the finest palaces in the world. Visiting this palace gives one a sense of pride and wonder about the glorious heritage of our country.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during the wedding of Jayalakshammani, the eldest daughter of Chamaraja Wodeyar in 1896.

<img class="img img2" src="https://bxmysuru.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Amba_Vilas_Palace_Mysore.jpg" alt="History" style="height: 18rem; width: 20rem;"> Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace. E.W. Fritchley worked as a consulting engineer. 
Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the nearby Jaganmohan Palace. Construction was overseen by an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used to plan the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $ 30 million adjusted to inflation) and the palace was completed in 1912.

The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.

The pioneer of modern yoga as exercise, Krishnamacharya, taught yoga in the palace in the early 20th century, at the request of the Raja of Mysore. Among his pupils there were B. K. S. Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, founders of Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga respectively. An earlier Raja had 112 yoga postures (asanas) illustrated in a large 19th century book, the Sritattvanidhi, which likely influenced Krishnamacharya.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The Mysore Palace is one of the most magnificent palaces in India and a masterpiece of architecture. It was designed by the British architect Henry Irwin and completed in 1912 after the old wooden palace was destroyed in a fire. The palace represents the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, which is a unique fusion of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. This combination makes the palace stand out as both a symbol of India’s cultural diversity and a reflection of royal grandeur.

From the outside, the palace looks like a fairy-tale structure with its three-storied design built of fine gray granite, beautifully crowned by pink marble domes. The central tower rises five stories high and is topped by a massive gilded dome that shines under sunlight, giving the palace an enchanting glow. There are several tall arches, expansive balconies, and majestic colonnades that add rhythm and symmetry to the entire façade. The architecture is highly decorative, with intricate carvings, floral motifs, and sculpted figures that reflect traditional Indian artistry while still showing traces of European influence.

One of the remarkable features of Mysore Palace is its grand gateways and entrances. The palace has beautifully designed arched gates that are both welcoming and imposing.
These arches are decorated with carvings and motifs inspired by mythological stories, floral designs, and geometric patterns. The tall corner towers with domed tops give the palace a fortress-like appearance while also highlighting its elegance. The entire structure is surrounded by vast gardens, adding to its royal charm and creating a sense of openness around the monument.

The interiors of the palace are even more breathtaking than the exterior. Every hall, corridor, and chamber is decorated with rich detail, showing the splendor of the Wadiyar dynasty. The Durbar Hall, used for ceremonial gatherings and royal addresses, is one of the highlights. It has massive pillars, decorated arches, and a stained-glass ceiling imported from Belgium. The hall is richly ornamented with chandeliers, paintings, and frescoes that depict scenes from Indian mythology. The floor is made of polished tiles with intricate patterns, giving the hall a grand royal ambiance.

Another important section is the Kalyana Mantapa (marriage pavilion), which is octagonal in shape and covered with stained glass and beautiful mosaic flooring. The stained-glass ceiling, decorated with peacock motifs, creates a colorful play of light inside the hall when sunlight passes through. This pavilion was used for royal weddings and other celebrations, making it one of the most iconic parts of the palace. The combination of decorative art, geometric designs, and vibrant colors reflects both Indian tradition and European artistry.
Throughout the palace, there are ornate doors, intricately carved wooden ceilings, silver and ivory decorations, and large paintings that narrate the stories of gods, kings, and festivals.

Its blend of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic features reflects both India’s diversity and the global influences of the colonial period. Every part of the palace, from its towering domes to its richly decorated halls, tells a story of grandeur, tradition, and architectural brilliance, making it one of the greatest architectural treasures of India.</p>
