        The <strong>Gateway of India</strong>, located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, is one of the most iconic 
        monuments of India. Built in 1924, it was constructed to commemorate the arrival of 
        King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Standing tall beside the Arabian Sea, it 
        symbolizes both India’s colonial past and its vibrant present.
