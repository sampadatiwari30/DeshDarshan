            Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Vinayaka Chavithi, is a Hindu festival celebrating the birthday of Lord Ganesh, the God of New Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles. The festival is observed with the installation of Ganesh murtis in homes and elaborate public pandals.

        <p class="full-text">
            Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata (fasting). Offerings and prasada from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the community, include sweets such as <b>modak</b> as it is believed to be a favourite of Ganesha.
            The festival ends on the tenth day, called Ananta Chaturdashi, when the murti is carried in a public procession and immersed in a nearby body of water (visarjana). In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 murtis are immersed annually.
            It is a state festival of Maharashtra, and is observed throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as by the Hindu diaspora globally. The festival typically falls between 22 August and 20 September every year.
            Although the origin remains unknown, it became increasingly popular after a public celebration was initiated by the prominent Anti-Colonial Freedom Fighter, <b>Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak</b>, in Maharashtra in 1893 as a means to foster Hindu nationalist identity and unity against British rule.

        </div>

        <p class="full-text">
            Though not alluding to the classical form of Ganapati, the earliest mention is found in the <b>Rigveda</b> (shloka 2.23.1 and 10.112.9). These ancient references imply a role of Ganapati as "the seer among the seers" and "lord of an invocation." However, it is uncertain if this Vedic term referred specifically to the later era Lord Ganesh, and the Vedic texts do not mention Ganesh Chaturthi.
            Ganesh appears in post-Vedic texts such as the <b>Grhya Sutras</b>, and ancient Sanskrit texts like the <b>Mahabharata</b> mention him as Ganesvaras and Vinayak. By the medieval Puranas (Skanda Purana, etc.), he is widely known as the "god of success, obstacle remover."

        <p class="full-text">
            Beyond texts, <b>archaeological and epigraphical evidence</b> shows Ganesha was revered before the 8th century CE. For example, carvings at Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples like the Ellora Caves, dating between the 5th and 8th centuries, show Ganesha seated reverentially with Shakti.

        <p class="full-text">
            Although the exact origins of the observance are unknown, the festival was publicly celebrated in Pune since the era of <b>King Shivaji</b> (1630–1680). The <b>Peshwa</b> later championed it as a public Ganesh festival in Pune. After the British Raj began, it became a private family celebration until its public revival.

        </div>

        <p class="full-text">
            Indian freedom fighter <b>Lokmanya Tilak</b> revived the public Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav in 1893. He leveraged Ganesh’s universal appeal ("the god for everybody") to bridge social gaps and circumvent the British government's ban on large political assemblies. The festival became a cover for political activism, intellectual discourse, poetry recitals, plays, and concerts.
            In <b>Goa</b>, the festival (known as <b>Chavath</b>) predates the Kadamba era. Due to the Goa Inquisition's ban on Hindu festivals, some families uniquely worship Ganesha using <i>patri</i> (leaves), paper drawings, or by hiding small silver idols to avoid restrictions.

            In <b>Maharashtra</b> (Ganeshotsav), small clay Murtis are installed. Celebrations end after a variable number of days (1½, 3, 5, 7, or 11 days). The festival often incorporates <b>Hartalika</b> (fasting by women) and the <b>Gauri festival</b>. In <b>Karnataka</b>, the <b>Gowri festival</b> precedes Ganesh Chaturthi.

        <h4>Public Celebration and Economic Impact</h4>
        <p class="full-text">
            Public celebrations are organized by local groups who install large Ganesh idols (ranging up to 20m/70ft) in temporary shelters called <b>mandaps or pandals</b>.

The festival features cultural activities (singing, plays) and community activities (free medical checkups, blood donation).
            In <b>Tamil Nadu</b> (Vinayaka/Pillayar Chaturthi), idols are usually made of <b>clay or papier-mâché</b> (Plaster of Paris idols are banned). In <b>Kerala</b> (Lamboodhara Piranalu), a procession marches from the Pazhavangadi Ganapathi Temple to Shankumugham Beach for immersion.
